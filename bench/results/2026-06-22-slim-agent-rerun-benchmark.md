# Slim Agent Benchmark Rerun - 2026-06-22

## Scope

This rerun uses the simplified 7-line `AGENT.md`:

```text
Build only what is needed now.
Prefer the smallest readable change.
Touch the fewest files needed.
Use existing code before adding new code.
Do not add abstractions for one-shot code.
Verify the result.
Stop when done.
```

The benchmark keeps the same expanded `natural` suite as the previous report:

- 18 ordinary bugfix tasks.
- 4 models.
- 2 variants: baseline prompt vs. prompt plus `AGENT.md`.
- 144 total runs.
- No future-feature bait.
- No instruction to avoid dependencies.
- No instruction to avoid refactors.
- No exposed scoring guardrails.

Raw artifacts are stored under `bench/runs-natural-slim/` and are ignored by git.

## Deltas

Positive total and quality deltas favor `disciplined`. Negative line delta change means `disciplined` used a smaller average patch.

| model | total delta | quality delta | line delta change |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| gpt-5.3-codex-spark | -1.18 | -5.56 | +0.17 |
| gpt-5.4 | +6.67 | +33.33 | +0.39 |
| gpt-5.4-mini | -0.42 | -5.56 | -0.56 |
| gpt-5.5 | -0.28 | +0.00 | +0.22 |

## Observations

- Every run passed tests. As before, pass rate does not expose the relevant difference.
- No run changed dependencies. This suite still does not reproduce dependency bloat.
- The 7-line `AGENT.md` produced mixed results rather than a uniform win.
- `gpt-5.4` showed a strong discipline benefit: total average improved from 93.19 to 99.86, and quality improved from 66.67 to 100.00.
- `gpt-5.3-codex-spark`, `gpt-5.4-mini`, and `gpt-5.5` did not improve on total score in this single rerun.
- `gpt-5.4-mini` did produce a smaller average patch under `disciplined`, but lost quality on two tasks.
- The fresh baselines differ from the previous report, so this suite still needs repeated runs before treating small deltas as stable.

## Conclusion

The simplified 7-line `AGENT.md` preserves the core positioning but weakens the measured claim:

`AGENT.md` still does not affect whether agents can complete these small bugfix tasks. All variants passed all tests. Its effect on coding discipline is now model-dependent and noisy: strongly positive for `gpt-5.4`, neutral or slightly negative for the other three models in this single rerun.

The conservative conclusion is that the tiny file is directionally useful as a low-cost discipline nudge, but this benchmark no longer supports saying it is consistently beneficial across all tested models.
